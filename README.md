# stockx-web-scraper-app-thingy
this is a stockx web scraper app thingy. I don't really have a vision for it but i'm just hacking around

#curr functionality
- this goes to stockx.com and get the top trending sneakers/streetwear
- i also cache in an apache cassandra db cause i noticed it was taking a while to query the stockx page

#initial setup
- install apache cassandra and beautiful soup
- then setup cassandra(instructions later) and create a keyspace, table, etc


#running
- go to root dir and run `python main.py`

.... more to come soon
